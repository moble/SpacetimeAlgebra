SpacetimeAlgebra
================

The geometric algebra of spacetime, now with python!

This collection of code contains C++ and python interfaces to code
expressing the geometric algebra of spacetime.  The core of this code
is generated by the excellent
[Gaigen](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~fontijne/g25.html) package,
while some of the interface is my own code.






Note that the best documentation on wrapping C++ libraries for python
with cython is not obvious, but is
[here](http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/wrapping_CPlusPlus.html).
